## Pre-requisite installation script 
#
# There are certain libraries required for Consequence 2 to work
# This script contains code to install the necessary packages and 
# make things easier 
#

#### Note -> It is easier to install these from the R command prompt instead of getting the source as the
#### dependancies can be installed along with the package 

install.packages("seqinr")				# Contains 544 AAindices 
install.packages("ada")					# Adaptive booster
install.packages("nnet")				# Neural Network
install.packages("randomForest")		# R implementation of Leo Brieman's RandomForest 
install.packages("caret")				#
